# Project Scan
Final year project, involving creating a virus scanner program.

You can visit our website at https://kmc2000.github.io/scanfinalyearproject/ to learn more!

# What can it do?:
This program scans files and, using some clever heuristics, determines whether or not it looks like malware or not. 
It will provide a confidence score and a classification, with the option to remove a file.

# Running
Ensure you have microsoft ASP.net 6 installed on your machine, you can get it here:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0
Download the software from the releases tab.

# Supported platforms:
We only explicitly support windows at this time.
